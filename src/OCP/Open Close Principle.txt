Open Close Principle ( OCP )

Def:
Software entities like classes , module, function should be open for Extension and closed for modification.

Exp:
Open close principle can be ensured by use  of Abstraction classes and Concrete classes for implementing their behavior.

This will enforce having concrete classes extending abstract class instead of changing them.

Some particular cases of this are Template Pattern and Strategy pattern.
